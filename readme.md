# MyNotes

Welcome to my personal knowledge base! 🚀

I started compiling these notes back in 2020 when I began my journey into penetration testing. What started as a simple way to track my learning has grown into a comprehensive collection covering everything from basic advanced ones.

Please keep in mind that this is a living document. I'm constantly learning, experimenting, and updating these pages as I explore new technologies and methodologies. The content here reflects my ongoing growth and experiences in the field.

Feel free to look around!
