## Question-24
#deployments
You have a project for your App Engine application that serves a development environment. The required testing has succeeded and you want to create a new project to serve as your production environment. What should you do?  

- ***A. Use gcloud to create the new project, and then deploy your application to the new project. Most Voted***
- B. Use gcloud to create the new project and to copy the deployed application to the new project.
- C. Create a Deployment Manager configuration file that copies the current App Engine deployment into a new project.
- D. Deploy your application again using gcloud and specify the project parameter with the new project name to create the new project.

## Question-26 
#iam
You need to set up permissions for a set of Compute Engine instances to enable them to write data into a particular Cloud Storage bucket. You want to follow  
Google-recommended practices. What should you do?  

- A. Create a service account with an access scope. Use the access scope 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.write_only'.
- B. Create a service account with an access scope. Use the access scope 'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform'.
- ***C. Create a service account and add it to the IAM role 'storage.objectCreator' for that bucket. Most Voted***
- D. Create a service account and add it to the IAM role 'storage.objectAdmin' for that bucket.

# Question-32
#monitoring
You need to monitor resources that are distributed over different projects in Google Cloud Platform. You want to consolidate reporting under the same Stackdriver  
Monitoring dashboard. What should you do?  

- A. Use Shared VPC to connect all projects, and link Stackdriver to one of the projects.
- B. For each project, create a Stackdriver account. In each project, create a service account for that project and grant it the role of Stackdriver Account Editor in all other projects.
- ***C. Configure a single Stackdriver account, and link all projects to the same account. Most Voted***
- D. Configure a single Stackdriver account for one of the projects. In Stackdriver, create a Group and add the other project names as criteria for that Group.
### Explanation:

1. **Single Stackdriver (Cloud Monitoring) Workspace**:
    
    - Google Cloud’s **Stackdriver Monitoring** (now called Cloud Monitoring) allows you to monitor resources across multiple projects by creating a **single Workspace**.
    - You can **link multiple projects** to the same Cloud Monitoring Workspace, enabling centralized monitoring and reporting.
2. **How It Works**:
    
    - Choose a primary project to host the **Workspace**.
    - Link the additional GCP projects (containing the distributed resources) to this Workspace.
    - All metrics, dashboards, and alerts can then be managed and viewed centrally.
3. **Benefits**:
    
    - A single Workspace provides a **consolidated view** of resources across projects.
    - It avoids creating unnecessary accounts or roles.
    - Simplifies monitoring setup and management.

### Why Not the Other Options?

- **A. Use Shared VPC and link Stackdriver to one of the projects**:
    
    - Shared VPC is for networking, not for consolidating monitoring data. Linking Stackdriver to a single project doesn’t automatically gather metrics across multiple projects.
- **B. Create a Stackdriver account per project and service accounts**:
    
    - Creating separate Stackdriver accounts is inefficient and unnecessarily complex. There’s no need to grant Stackdriver roles across all projects.
- **D. Create a Group and add project names as criteria**:
    
    - Stackdriver Groups help organize resources **within** a Workspace but do not consolidate monitoring data across projects. A single Workspace is still required to centralize metrics.
