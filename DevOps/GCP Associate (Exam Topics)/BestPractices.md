# General-Notes

- **Proactive Monitoring**: Implement continuous monitoring and logging to detect and resolve issues before they affect users.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clearly separate development, staging, and production environments to avoid unintentional changes impacting live systems.
- **Documentation**: Maintain updated documentation for processes, configurations, and troubleshooting procedures.

# Health-Checks
## Autoscaling

- **Scaling Policies**:
    - Use CPU utilization, request count, or custom metrics to define scaling triggers.
    - Set minimum and maximum instance limits to control resource costs.
- **Testing**: Simulate traffic spikes to ensure autoscaling meets application demands without delays.

---
# Traffic-Routing

- **Routing Strategies**:
    - Implement URL-based routing for web applications.
    - Use weighted load balancing to distribute traffic based on backend capacities.
- **Failover**: Configure failover strategies to redirect traffic in case of backend failures.

---
# Security-and-DDoS-Protection

- **Cloud Armor**: Use Cloud Armor to define security policies and protect against common attacks.
- **Encryption**:
    - Enable HTTPS and SSL/TLS to secure communication.
    - Use encryption for data at rest and in transit.
- **IAM Policies**: Apply the principle of least privilege for access control.

# Monitoring-Tools

- **Cloud Monitoring**:
    - Set up alerts for key metrics such as latency, error rates, and CPU usage.
    - Visualize data using dashboards for real-time insights.
- **Cloud Logging**:
    - Enable logging for all critical services.
    - Regularly review logs to identify anomalies and performance bottlenecks.
- **Audit Logs**: Use audit logs to track access and changes to resources.
