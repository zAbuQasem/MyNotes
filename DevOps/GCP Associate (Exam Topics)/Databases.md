##  Choosing the Right Service

- **Relational** (Cloud SQL, Cloud Spanner): Best for structured data and transactional consistency. Choose **Cloud SQL** for simpler, smaller-scale databases, and **Cloud Spanner** for global scale with strong consistency.
- **NoSQL** (Firestore, Bigtable): Ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data. **Firestore** offers a flexible, document-oriented approach with real-time updates; **Bigtable** is for extremely large-scale, low-latency workloads (wide-column model).
- **Analytics** (BigQuery): Best suited for large-scale analytical queries and data warehousing.
- **Object Storage** (Cloud Storage): Good for storing and archiving files and objects with various storage classes for different access frequencies.
- **Block & File Storage** (Persistent Disk, Filestore): For VM-based applications requiring block devices (Persistent Disk) or shared file systems (Filestore).
